# Tic-Tac-Toe Web
Just practicing my web development skills by making this project and polishing my programming logics skills.

<b>This will update time to time!</b>

## Usage
Just Visit the website : https://hackwarebro.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Web/

This tic-tac-toe supports 2 player and CPU mode to play.
CPU mode is based on random function not based on any AI.

And gameplay is well known by majority so no need to define anything.
